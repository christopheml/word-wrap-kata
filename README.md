Word Wrap Kata
==============

This is my own implementation of the Word Wrap Kata using TDD.

The goal of this kata is to insert line breaks into a text to make it fit a desired width (i.e. no line is longer than
the width).
Line breaks should be inserted between words if possible (by replacing the space).
